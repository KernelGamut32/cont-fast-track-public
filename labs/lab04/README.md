# Lab 04

## Use Docker-Compose

* Exercise 1: https://github.com/CarlitosDroid/docker-compose-nodejs-mysql

    Test run of node app and db query. Update SQL script to add a new table and/or new records and rerun.
	If time permits, add a simple JSON display of the db records on the page.

* Exercise 2: https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/vuejs

    Get the base Vue.js container up and running. Using one of the other examples in the `awesome-compose` repo, expand to include a database container (your choice of type). Make sure the Vue.js container waits for the database container to spin up.

    If you'd like (and feel comfortable with the code), make modifications to the Vue.js code (including integrating with the database for simple JSON display).

* Exercise 3: Build a multi-container deployment using at least 2 technology images of your choice. If you feel comfortable, integrate the containers in an interesting way (i.e., have a node API call to a mysql database and demonstrate via GET in browser or Postman, etc.).
